# About

An e-commerce backend api built with django rest framework

# Notes

### 1/ Cart
Yet to start anything until login systems have been set up.

### 2/ Core
Still working on the login endpoints
Decided to go with the rest_framework authtoken because of "Authorization: Token: token"
Need to add validators for the user
Working on the logout endpoint

### 3/ Customers
Complete, for now.

### 4/ Product
Search functionality yet to be implemented

### 5/ Admin
Yet to start.

### 6/ AOB
The product create endpoint should be protected with admin privileges.
It may have to be separated from the product list endpoint which means the program may not be so restful, unfortunately.
